This directory contains files used to package pocketchanged/pocketchange-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile pocketchanged/pocketchange-qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

pocketchange: URI support
--------------------

pocketchange-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install pocketchange-qt.desktop
  sudo update-desktop-database

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your pocketchange-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/pocketchange128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps

pocketchange-qt.protocol (KDE)
